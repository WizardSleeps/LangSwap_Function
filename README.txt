# How to create a disassembled file:

1. Right click the source file (A) in the context menu
2. From the context menu, select "Dissassemble" option, the Disassemble Job window will appear

The disassembling file provides a table of object code produced from the C/C++ source file in the Editor.
Once the Disassemble command is executed, it will compile then disassemble the file. This will show the resulting
disassembled file in a new Editor window (Titled: sourcefilenameXXXXX.lst, where XXXXX represent random number).

When all goes good and well, you will be presented by an annotation of the code that is being wellfully explained.
